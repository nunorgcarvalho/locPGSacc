\arguments{
\item{data}{data table containing all necessary columns and rows}

\item{col_dim}{character: column name of the dimension variable for which to compute bands from}

\item{col_pheno}{character: column name of the phenotype of interest}

\item{col_PGS}{character: column name of the polygenic scores for the phenotype of interest}

\item{i_omit}{(optional) numeric vector: indices of data rows for which to not consider at all in nearest neighbor algorithm}

\item{window}{(optional) numeric: proportion of the distribution, centered at the median, to include when making bands}

\item{bands}{(optional) integer: number of bands (i.e. sections) to split up the sample by according to the dimensional variable}
